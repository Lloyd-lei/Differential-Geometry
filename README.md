<h2>Task 1: Coordinate Transformation and Parallel Transport</h2>

<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Coordinate Systems:</b> The conversion between spherical, Cartesian, and cylindrical coordinates is crucial for physics simulations. Each coordinate system represents spatial positions differently:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Spherical: \( (r, \theta, \phi) \) </li>
    <li>Cartesian: \( (x, y, z) \) </li>
    <li>Cylindrical: \( (\rho, \psi, z) \) </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Parallel Transport:</b> This involves moving a vector along a curved surface (e.g., a sphere) while preserving its inner product with the local tangent space. The process reveals the <i>holonomy</i>, which is a measure of the vectorâ€™s deviation after being transported around a closed loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithms for Visualization</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mesh Generation:</b> A sphere is typically represented using a discretized mesh, which requires defining a set of grid points and triangulating them.</li>
  <li><b>Vector Field Plotting:</b> The local orthonormal basis vectors need to be plotted at different locations on the sphere.</li>
  <li><b>Parallel Transport Animation:</b> The trajectory of the vector as it moves along the surface is visualized using an animated quiver plot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Structures Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Numpy Arrays:</b> Efficient storage of coordinate transformations.</li>
  <li><b>Matplotlib (3D Plots):</b> Visualization of the coordinate transformations and parallel transport.</li>

<h2>Task 2: Geometric Transformations (Stereographic Projection)</h2>

<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Stereographic Projection:</b> A function that maps a point \( (x, y, z) \) on a sphere to a 2D plane:</li>
  <p> \[
  P' = \frac{x \hat{x} + y \hat{y}}{1 - z}
  \] </p>
  <li>This projection is **conformal**, meaning it preserves angles but not distances.</li>
  <li><b>Great Circles and Geodesics:</b> The shortest paths on a sphere are mapped to circles or straight lines in the projection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithms for Visualization</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Sphere Mesh Generation:</b> A uniform mesh of points on the unit sphere is created.</li>
  <li><b>Projection Calculation:</b> Each point is mapped to the 2D plane using the stereographic formula.</li>
  <li><b>Contour Mapping:</b> Verifying conformality by ensuring that angles between intersecting curves remain the same after projection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Structures Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mesh Grids:</b> A grid-based representation of the sphere.</li>
  <li><b>Matplotlib Contours:</b> Used to visualize transformed curves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applications in Physics and Data Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Used in **complex analysis**, where conformal mappings help solve differential equations.</li>
  <li>Applied in **computer vision** and **VR rendering**, where 3D objects are mapped to 2D displays.</li>
  <li>Appears in **quantum mechanics**, where wavefunctions on curved spaces can be analyzed using projections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Delaunay Triangulation:</b> A method to divide a set of 2D points into triangles such that the circumcircle of each triangle does not contain any other points.</li>
  <li><b>Lifting Map:</b> A transformation that maps a 2D surface into 3D using a function like:</li>
  <p> \[
  z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
  \] </p>
  <li><b>Surface Curvature:</b> The shape operator and fundamental forms describe the curvature of the lifted surface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithms for Visualization</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Convex Hull Computation:</b> The convex envelope of a point cloud is found.</li>
  <li><b>Heatmap Visualization:</b> The difference in triangle areas before and after lifting is visualized using a 2D heatmap.</li>
  <li><b>Curvature Estimation:</b> Principal, Gaussian, and mean curvatures are computed for each vertex.</li>
